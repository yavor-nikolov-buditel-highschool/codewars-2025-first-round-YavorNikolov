# 🚀 ISS Paradox – Spaceship Control Panel

## 🛰️ Overview

**ISS Paradox – Spaceship Control Panel** is a futuristic, sci-fi themed web interface that simulates the control dashboard of a deep-space research vessel. The project focuses entirely on **visual design, UI/UX, and frontend interactions**, presenting ship systems, crew information, and real-time-style system statuses through an immersive control panel experience.

This project was created for **CodeWars 2025 – First Round**.

---

## 🧠 Project Concept

The interface represents a fictional spaceship, **ISS Paradox**, operating beyond known space. The control panel visualizes:

- Ship systems and diagnostics  
- Crew manifest and individual crew profiles  
- Simulated system graphs and indicators  
- A sentient onboard AI system  

All data is **static or simulated**, designed purely for visual and interactive purposes.

## 📄 Pages & Structure

The website consists of **8 pages**, implemented as **separate HTML files**:

- `index.html` – Home / Main Control Panel  
- `crew.html` – Crew Manifest  
- `crew-member.html` – Individual Crew Member Profile  
- `status.html` – Ship Status & Systems  
- Additional system-focused views integrated through navigation and UI panels  

Navigation is available and visible on all pages.
